# Server-Client-Connection

- Server Script should be initialized first as it is put in the listening mode(means it will wait for the upcoming connection)
- After connecting you can type your messages(Etheir by taking input or as i have done it)
- In bind/connect function make sure ip and port for the both server and client should be same
- For more info you can look into this : https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html
